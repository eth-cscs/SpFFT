SpFFT Documentation
===================
| SpFFT - A 3D FFT library for sparse frequency domain data written in C++ with support for MPI, OpenMP, CUDA and ROCm. It was originally intended for transforms of data with spherical cutoff in frequency domain, as required by some computational material science codes.

| For distributed computations, SpFFT uses a slab decomposition in space domain and pencil decomposition in frequency domain (all sparse data within a pencil must be on one rank). If desired, the libray can be compiled without any parallization (MPI, OpenMP, CUDA / ROCm).


Design Goals
------------

- Sparse frequency domain input
- Reuse of pre-allocated memory
- Support of negative indexing for frequency domain data
- Unified interface for calculations on CPUs and GPUs
- Support of Complex-To-Real and Real-To-Complex transforms, where the full hermitian symmetry property is utilized.
- C++, C and Fortran interfaces

Interface Design
----------------
To allow for pre-allocation and reuse of memory, the design is based on two classes:

- **Grid**: Allocates memory for transforms up to a given size in each dimension.
- **Transform**: Is associated with a *Grid* and can have any size up to the *Grid* dimensions. A *Transform* holds a counted reference to the underlying *Grid*. Therefore, *Transforms* created with the same *Grid* share memory, which is only freed, once the *Grid* and all associated *Transforms* are destroyed.

The user provides memory for storing sparse frequency domain data, while a *Transform* provides memory for space domain data. This implies, that executing a *Transform* will override the space domain data of all other *Transforms* associated with the same *Grid*.

.. note::
   The creation of Grids and Transforms, as well as the forward and backward execution may entail MPI calls and must be synchronized between all ranks.
